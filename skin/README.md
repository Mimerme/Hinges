# Skins
Skins are customizations for the client both frontend and backend, meaning you can add your own features or just make it look pretty
#What can skins do?
- Load their own libraries
- Load HTML/JavaScript/CSS files
- Load NodeJS libraries
  - and do whatever those libraries are capable of doing

There are essentially no restrictions on what skins can do, thus allowing for maximum flexibility
